### The Collaborative Approach to Evolution

**In a decentralized world, the door to collaboration is documentation**

Documentation enables collaboration by allowing a willing participant to engage in a given subject without permission, direction or interference of other participants by making accessible the given state and potentials for interacting with said subject. Of course, the success of this interaction, assuming no guidance from other participants, is highly dependent on the quality of the documentation and proportionally raises and lowers the barriers-to-entry otherwise defined by subject fluency, level of related skills, strength of initiative and mental fortitude, etc.

However, it should be recognized that documentation may also be a "double-edged sword" so to speak, as while it helps with a specific function, it may also hinder. The largest example of this being the process of documentation superseding or inhibiting the main purpose or subject. Thus we need to set some guidelines in order to achieve the most efficient equilibrium between development and documentation.


### Keep it Simple

- Work in outlines
  1. Using both order and unordered list to organize thoughts and topics 
	  - The main purpose is to get the thoughts out of your head into writing
  2. Short statements or even just a word or two can be used
     - Context is provided by hierarchy within the outline and priority by order
- Be as succinct and clear as possible
  1. Focus on a single thought into a given point
	  - Use nested lists and items to add detail
  2. If there are too many details and the list grows excessive, this may be an indication for breaking out to a new outline. 
	  - If sub-bullets go deeper than three levels, this may be an indication for breaking apart thoughts.
